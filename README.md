# markdownlint-rule-github-internal-links

Custom [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) rule for
checking internal links like those generated by Github's Markdown processor.
Specifically, this rule checks that internal links (of the form `#anchor`)
match the anchors generated by
[this anchor generation code](https://github.com/jch/html-pipeline/blob/master/lib/html/pipeline/toc_filter.rb).

For example, in [this README.md](README.md),
[the link `#configuration`](#configuration) will not report an error,
while [the link `#config`](#config) will.

## Usage

1. Add this package to your project:

   ```sh
   npm install -D markdownlint-rule-github-internal-links
   ```

2. Enable the rule in your call to
   [markdownlint-cli](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli):

   ```sh
   markdownlint ... --rules markdownlint-rule-github-internal-links
   ```

   See the sample `test` script in [this `package.json`](package.json).

## Configuration

You can pass in a setting of `verbose: true` to make this plugin display
every anchor link it computes and every link it tests.  This can be useful
for debugging your anchor links, when it's hard to guess how many `-`s to add.
See [sample .markdownlint.yaml](.markdownlint.yaml).
